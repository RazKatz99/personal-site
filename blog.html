            <h1>Building My First AI-Assisted Portfolio</h1>
            <span class="date">February 23, 2026</span>
            <p>For my DATA 305 assignment, I was tasked with building a personal website hosted on GitHub Pages, acting as both a resume and a blog. The twist? I had to use a Generative AI assistant to help me research and build it.</p>
            <p>Lately, I've been spending a lot of time wrapping my head around C++ and Python syntax for different classes and projects. Building this site was a completely different experience. Instead of grinding through logic and debugging line by line, I acted more like a project manager. I decided on the architecture (Plain HTML/CSS) and directed the AI on the design, layout, and content structure.</p>
            <p>It was fascinating to see how quickly a prompt could turn my actual CV into a fully styled webpage. It definitely highlighted the importance of clear communication—the more specific I was about the W&M color scheme and responsive design, the better the output. Overall, it's a huge shift in how we approach web development!</p>
